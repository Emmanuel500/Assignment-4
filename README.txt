Homework 4

1. Use the Makefile to create the executable:
	*NOTE: Make sure to call your tester file main.c
		$make
  
2. Export the current library:
	*NOTE:	$make - prints the export command with directory path, so just copy-paste the command
	
	The command should look like this:
		$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[directory path]

3. Run the executable:
	$./myprogram

4. Use the Makefile to clean the directory:
	$make clean
