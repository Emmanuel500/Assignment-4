Homework 4

1. Use the Makefile to create the executable:
	$make
  
2. Export the current library
  *NOTE: $make prints the export command with directory path, so just copy-paste the command
  
  The command should look like this:
    $export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[directory path]

3. Run the executable:
  $./myprogram

4. Use the Makefile to clean the directory:
	$make clean
